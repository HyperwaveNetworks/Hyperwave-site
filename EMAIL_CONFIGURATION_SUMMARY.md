# Email Configuration Summary - Hyperwave Networks

## ‚úÖ Current Status
The contact form email functionality is now **FULLY WORKING** with the following configuration:

### Development Mode (DEBUG=True)

- **Purpose**: Prevents sending actual emails during development/testing
- **Benefit**: You can review email content without spamming real inboxes

- **Port**: 587 (TLS encryption)
- **Username**: `info@hyperwave.co.ke`
- **Password**: `Hyp3rw@V3N3t`

## üìß Contact Form Features
